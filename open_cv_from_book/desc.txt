detectMultiScale():

image : Matrix of the type CV_8U containing an image where objects are detected.
scaleFactor : Parameter specifying how much the image size is reduced at each image scale.
This scale factor is used to create scale pyramid as shown in the picture. Suppose, the scale factor is 1.03, it means we're using a small step for resizing, i.e. reduce size by 3 %, we increase the chance of a matching size with the model for detection is found, while it's expensive.
minNeighbors : Parameter specifying how many neighbors each candidate rectangle should have to retain it. This parameter will affect the quality of the detected faces: higher value results in less detections but with higher quality. We're using 5 in the code.
flags : Parameter with the same meaning for an old cascade as in the function cvHaarDetectObjects. It is not used for a new cascade.
minSize : Minimum possible object size. Objects smaller than that are ignored.
maxSize : Maximum possible object size. Objects larger than that are ignored.
